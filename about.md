My name is Anennya (if you didn't already get that from the name of the blog, or the url or my username).
I have degrees in Applied Math and Economics. I work as a data analyst for a small company and I kinda like it. 
I live in San Francisco with my husband. 

    
Right now my ambition is to rekindle my curiosity and steer my everyday life away from feeling like I am constantly preparing for a job interview (no, I am not actually preparing for an interview nor am I looking for a job) - that is, having to present what I know well, use my "extensive" knowledge to contribute, prove my passion for the job and product and exhibit confidence.

I am hoping this blog will help me with that. I want to learn for the sake of learning and share what I retain. So stay tuned!
